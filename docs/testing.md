## Unit tests
We are using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for Unit testing.

### How to run tests
`npm run test:unit` will run the tests in watch mode.

`npm run test:unit:coverage` will run the tests in watch mode with coverage.

`npm run test:unit:ui` will run the tests in watch mode with coverage and with [Vitest UI](https://vitest.dev/guide/ui.html#vitest-ui).
