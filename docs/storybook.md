## Storybook

### Decision

### Good to know
- Currently using `VITE_CJS_IGNORE_WARNING=true` but it should be fixed in Storybook 8 see [here](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/24333#issuecomment-1858298167)
- Using CSF3 + TypeScript syntax as per the [docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/typescript)
